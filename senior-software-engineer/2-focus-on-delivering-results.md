# Focus on delivering results

## What are results

* There is a difference betweeen _deliverables_ and _results_. All _results_ are _deliverables_ but **not all _deliverables_ are _results_**.
* A _result_ is something that **provides a direct business value**
  * Working code
  * Documentation
  * Definitive statements, ex. answers to questions
* Other stuff (reports, schedules, other deliverables) is useful, but not as much

## How to focus

* Keep promises to a minimum
* Weigh priorities on different questions/tasks, delegate if necessary, keep promises to a minimum

* Move away from large tasks/projects

## Deliver smaller results more often

* Reduce scope to the problem at hand and deliver a solution for that

## Plans, schedules and status reports

* Keep it private if you don't have to make it public
* Know which parts to make public if you have to do so

## Know when to move on

* Know when to work around a roadblock
* Know when to compromise
* Know when to move on
