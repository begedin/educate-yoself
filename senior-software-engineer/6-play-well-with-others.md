# Play well with others

* How to communicate information to people with different levels/areas of expertise

## Empathize with your audience

* Different parties have different knowledge/skills related to the issue.
* They also have different sets of priorities and constraints that you might not be aware of.

* Learn to communicate the problem so that _non technical_ people understand it
* Learn to push back when you know you're asked to solve the wrong problem - explain


## Adapt and abstract information

### Adapt terms

* Figure out a _simple API_ to convey information with
* Create an _adapter_ to the complex API you understand and _abstract_ away the details the other party doesn't need.
* Be careful when using _jargon_. The meaning might get lost or even change completely depending on the other party.
* Generally, avoid technical jargon of your own
* Listen carefuly to other people's jargon and ask questions if you aren't 100% sure what the words mean
* Don't talk down. The other person isn't dumb. They just have different areas of knowledge.
* Use longer descriptive phrases in place of acronyms or other jargon

### Abstract concepts to simplify them

* Start slowly, in broad strokes
* Avoid edge cases initially - they confuse and distract
* Avoid technical details
* Explain things using analogies, don't worry about precision
* Use diagrams, visual aids, demonstrations
* Offer to provide more details if needed
* If a question takes you off course, re-establish the context before continuing
* Be ready to _justify_ your position if challenged, by gradually increasing the level of detail

* **It's not the other person's job to understand you, it's your job to make sure they understand.**
* Stop and regroup if it goes poorly. Ask for advice from other technical people
* Be wary of solving the wrong problem. People will sometimes ask for specific solutions instead of explaining what their problem is. **Stop and ask what the real problem is.**
